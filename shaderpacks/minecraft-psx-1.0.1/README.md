## Installation

Clone the repo and place it in your shaderpacks folder: `%appdata%\.minecraft\shaderpacks` or download the latest release and place it into your shaderpacks folder.

## Known Issues

- Beacon beams tilt and do weird things when terrain vertex snapping is on due to [this Optifine bug](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/4905).  If anyone knows the block entity ID of beacon beams or whatever it is to single it out in gbuffers_block, please let me know.
